# Endroits App
A few comments on the structure of the app:
- Used clean architecture + MVP pattern
- Used Dagger for dependency injection
- Ordered list of places from closest to farthest (and included all food-related places, not just restaurants)
- Only wrote unit tests (but not UI tests) for the 'home' feature in an effort to save time
